# DeAnza-CIS-74-Spring-2016

This repo contains my solutions to lab exercises, assignments, and midterm/final exam coding problems for **CIS 74** (*Computer Software Quality Assurance*) - a class I taught at De Anza College in Cupertino, California, during the Spring Quarter 2016.

For their last lab exercise in this course, students were required to create a repo similar to this one with *their* solutions. 

This repo served two purposes:

* An example of what I was expecting students to produce for their last lab exercise; and
* A long-term repo for my solutions to their lab exercises, assignments, and midterm/final exam coding problems.
